So, in general, while uncertainty is important in predicting the future path of output growth in the twelve advanced economies considered, a forecaster can do better in majority of the instances by just considering the information from standard macroeconomic variables.', 'PUNCT NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP NUM ADP NUM PUNCT VERB DET ADP PUNCT NOUN ADP NUM ADP NUM PUNCT ADV VERB ADV NUM NOUN ADP NOUN ADV ADJ NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADJ ADJ PROPN PUNCT PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB PROPN NOUN VERB ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PROPN NOUN DET VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADP ADJ PUNCT ADP NOUN VERB ADJ ADP VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET NUM ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ PROPN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128], [-126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

How much time and money should be spent to attempt to stem the tide of illegal filesharing through mass lawsuits against Internet users? Could resources be better used elsewhere, such as discovering alternative business models that better embrace the new distribution capabilites? When the smoke clears from this current round of lawsuits, will copyright owners have a new businessmodel, or will this just be another misstep of copyright owners trying to stem the tide of infringement through litigation?

The experimental results showed that CTC based End-To-End models are competitive to traditional models with only 5% of WER worse for Vietnamese speech recognition (SR), but the advantage is no requirement of forced alignment for training acoustic models.

Meanwhile, a high optical transmittance of over 96.6% was demonstrated in a wavelength range between 350 and 1100\xa0nm.', 'PUNCT PUNCT PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN PUNCT NUM SPACE NUM SPACE NUM PUNCT NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET VERB NOUN VERB ADP NUM SPACE PROPN NOUN PUNCT VERB VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADP NUM SPACE NUM SPACE NUM NOUN SPACE NOUN SPACE NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT ADP ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADP NUM SPACE VERB NUM PROPN SPACE NOUN CCONJ NUM SPACE NUM SPACE NUM NUM SPACE VERB NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PROPN NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP DET VERB ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP ADP NUM NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP NUM CCONJ NUM SPACE NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN PUNCT PROPN', 'VERB NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142], [-140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

['NSCLC', 'non-small cell lung cancer', '). However, the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapies using ALK inhibitors is almost universally limited by drug resistance. Drug resistance to molecularly targeted therapies has now become a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. It is of particular importance to provide an improved understanding on the mechanisms of resistance of ALK inhibitors, thus rational new therapeutic strategies can be developed to combat resistance. We used state-of-the-art computational approaches to systematically explore the mutational effects of ALK mutations on drug resistance properties. We found the activation of ALK was increased by substitution with destabilizing mutations, creating the capacity to confer drug resistance to inhibitors. In addition, results implied that evolutionary constraints might affect the drug resistance properties. Moreover, an extensive profile of drugs against ALK mutations was constructed to give better understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance based on structural transitions and energetic variation. Our work hopes to provide an up-to-date mechanistic framework for understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance induced by ALK mutations, thus tailor treatment decisions after the emergence of resistance in ALK-dependent diseases.', 'PUNCT PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADV VERB NOUN VERB PROPN NOUN VERB ADV ADV VERB ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP ADV VERB NOUN VERB ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT DET PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN PART ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PART VERB NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183], [-180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

Based on a monthly out-of-sample period of 2009:06 to 2017:05, given an in-sample of 2003:03 to 2009:05, there are only 46 percent of cases where domestic uncertainty can improve the forecast of output growth relative to a baseline monetary TVP-PVAR model, which includes inflation, interest rate and nominal exchange rate growth, besides output growth. Moreover, including US uncertainty does not necessarily improve the forecasting performance of output growth from the TVP-PVAR model which includes only the domestic uncertainty along with the baseline variables. So, in general, while uncertainty is important in predicting the future path of output growth in the twelve advanced economies considered, a forecaster can do better in majority of the instances by just considering the information from standard macroeconomic variables.', 'PUNCT NOUN PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP NUM ADP NUM PUNCT VERB DET ADP PUNCT NOUN ADP NUM ADP NUM PUNCT ADV VERB ADV NUM NOUN ADP NOUN ADV ADJ NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADJ ADJ PROPN PUNCT PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT VERB PROPN NOUN VERB ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PROPN NOUN DET VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADP ADJ PUNCT ADP NOUN VERB ADJ ADP VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET NUM ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ PROPN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128], [-126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

Could resources be better used elsewhere, such as discovering alternative business models that better embrace the new distribution capabilites?

The experimental results showed that CTC based End-To-End models are competitive to traditional models with only 5% of WER worse for Vietnamese speech recognition (SR), but the advantage is no requirement of forced alignment for training acoustic models.

Contrary to thermal plasmas (with gas temperature ;> combustion temperature = 2300 °K), the pollution control efficiency of non-thermal plasmas is based on a "focused" effect of high energy particles on particular compounds (J). Therefore, non-thermal plasmas can be used for a selective destruction of dilute concentrations of toxic compounds.

['NSCLC', 'non-small cell lung cancer', '). However, the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapies using ALK inhibitors is almost universally limited by drug resistance. Drug resistance to molecularly targeted therapies has now become a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. It is of particular importance to provide an improved understanding on the mechanisms of resistance of ALK inhibitors, thus rational new therapeutic strategies can be developed to combat resistance. We used state-of-the-art computational approaches to systematically explore the mutational effects of ALK mutations on drug resistance properties. We found the activation of ALK was increased by substitution with destabilizing mutations, creating the capacity to confer drug resistance to inhibitors. In addition, results implied that evolutionary constraints might affect the drug resistance properties. Moreover, an extensive profile of drugs against ALK mutations was constructed to give better understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance based on structural transitions and energetic variation. Our work hopes to provide an up-to-date mechanistic framework for understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance induced by ALK mutations, thus tailor treatment decisions after the emergence of resistance in ALK-dependent diseases.', 'PUNCT PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADV VERB NOUN VERB PROPN NOUN VERB ADV ADV VERB ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP ADV VERB NOUN VERB ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT DET PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN PART ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PART VERB NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183], [-180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

The UV-VIS spectra of the doped glasses have been recorded in the range from 200 to 800 nm, before and after γ– irradiation with various doses. The cut off wavelength of the doped glasses was found to decrease with increasing Fe2O3 content, while it increased by increasing γ–irradiation dose. The analysis of the optical absorption spectra revealed that all the glass samples exhibited indirect optical transition. The optical band gap energy (Eg) was found to decrease with increasing γ–irradiation dose, while the urbach energy (Eu) increased. The decrease in the optical band gap and consequently the increase in Urbach energy confirmed more extension of the localized states within the band gap which indicated an increase in the disorder of the glass network.

Patients with long QT syndrome 1 (LQTS-1) typically may suffer cardiac arrest during exercise. Based on these observations beta-blocker therapy is recommended in these patients to reduce the maximal heart rate and blunt the effects of adrenaline. Energy drinks contain high doses of taurine (an amino acid), caffeine and glucuronolactone (a glucose metabolite), neither of which is considered to have significant toxicity. We report a case of a 22 year old female with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to initial torsades de pointes tachycardia secondary degenerating to ventricular fibrillation. Sudden cardiac death occurred without prodrome in a discotheque. Basic life support was performed immediately. After 15 minutes of resuscitation with fractionated administration of 3 mg adrenaline return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) could be achieved after the patient received five 360 Joule shocks by the emergency medical services personnel.

Therefore to identify diff erent varieties of persimmon there are nowadays applied techniques based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) (Nakamura and Kobayashi, 1994), random amplifi cation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Thaipong et al., 2003; Yamagishi et al., 2005; Yýldýz, et al., 2007; Akbulut et al., 2008; Zahng et al., 2009), amplifi ed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (Yonemori et al., 2008) or single sequence repeat (SSR) (Guo and Luo, 2011). RAPD markers have been used successfully for estimating genetic relationships in several fruit crops such as apple (Koller et al., 1993), peach (Badenes et al., 1998), almond (Bartolozzi et al., 1998), plum (Boonprakob et al., 2001), guava (Prakash et al., 2002), grapevine (Ulanovsky et al., 2002), apricot (Ercisli et al., 2009), citrus fruit (Ji et al., 2011) and also persimmon (Thaipong et al., 2003; Bellini et al., 2003). The RAPD method seems to be a very eff ective indicator of diff erent persimmon cultivars (Nakamura and Kobayashi, 1994). One recently described retrotransposon-based molecular marker technique was used to identify the varieties (Mondini et al., 2009). There are several retrotransposon-based molecular methods which require sequence information to design elementspecifi c primers (Kalendar, 2011; Kalendar et al., 2011). Retrotransposons are kind of elements which can be found in the genome of many eukaryotic organisms (Kumar and Bennetzen, 1999). One retrotransposon-based molecular method does not require previous sequence knowledge, it’s i-PBS (inter-primer binding site). I-PBS primers were designed according the highly conservative sequences called Primer Binding Site (PBS) to which tRNA binds, acting as a primer for reverse transcriptase during the replication cycle of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons. I-PBS is a universal and effi cient method from identifi cation of polymorphism (Kalendar et al, 2010; Kalendar, 2011; Kalendar et al., 2011). The aim of this paper was to diff erentiate persimmon collection by means of RAPD and i-PBS methods, study genetic diversity within persimmon collection and to incorporate a unknown persimmon cultivars in the dendrogram.

['RFLP', 'restriction fragment length polymorphisms', ') (Nakamura and Kobayashi, 1994), random amplifi cation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Thaipong et al., 2003; Yamagishi et al., 2005; Yýldýz, et al., 2007; Akbulut et al., 2008; Zahng et al., 2009), amplifi ed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (Yonemori et al., 2008) or single sequence repeat (SSR) (Guo and Luo, 2011). RAPD markers have been used successfully for estimating genetic relationships in several fruit crops such as apple (Koller et al., 1993), peach (Badenes et al., 1998), almond (Bartolozzi et al., 1998), plum (Boonprakob et al., 2001), guava (Prakash et al., 2002), grapevine (Ulanovsky et al., 2002), apricot (Ercisli et al., 2009), citrus fruit (Ji et al., 2011) and also persimmon (Thaipong et al., 2003; Bellini et al., 2003). The RAPD method seems to be a very eff ective indicator of diff erent persimmon cultivars (Nakamura and Kobayashi, 1994). One recently described retrotransposon-based molecular marker technique was used to identify the varieties (Mondini et al., 2009). There are several retrotransposon-based molecular methods which require sequence information to design elementspecifi c primers (Kalendar, 2011; Kalendar et al., 2011). Retrotransposons are kind of elements which can be found in the genome of many eukaryotic organisms (Kumar and Bennetzen, 1999). One retrotransposon-based molecular method does not require previous sequence knowledge, it’s i-PBS (inter-primer binding site). I-PBS primers were designed according the highly conservative sequences called Primer Binding Site (PBS) to which tRNA binds, acting as a primer for reverse transcriptase during the replication cycle of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons. I-PBS is a universal and effi cient method from identifi cation of polymorphism (Kalendar et al, 2010; Kalendar, 2011; Kalendar et al., 2011). The aim of this paper was to diff erentiate persimmon collection by means of RAPD and i-PBS methods, study genetic diversity within persimmon collection and to incorporate a unknown persimmon cultivars in the dendrogram.

However, it is hardly used for screening large-scale drugs because of the large number of animals and complex mechanisms involved in-vivo. In this study, we focused on whether T lymphocytes from CHS mouse model could maintain the state of immune response in-vitro and explored a suitable time for drugs screening. The results showed that CD4(+) T cells of CHS mice were higher compared with those in normal group. The expression of T-bet and GATA3 showed a Th1 shift and the levels of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 also showed similar trend. Furthermore, IL-6 produced by T lymphocytes from CHS mice had a high level too. Then, we detected the effects of dexamethasone (DEX), cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on T lymphocytes in-vitro, and the data displayed that these immunosuppressive drugs could all inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes significantly. These findings suggested that T lymphocytes from CHS mice could mimic a similar immune response in-vitro, and it's also a suitable method for screening anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.", 'PUNCT VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN NUM PUNCT ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP VERB ADJ ADJ ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON VERB ADV VERB ADP VERB ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADP PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADP PROPN VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ VERB ADP DET ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN CCONJ PROPN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PROPN VERB ADP PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT VERB PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN ADP PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADP PROPN NOUN ADP PUNCT X PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADV PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP PROPN VERB ADP NOUN NOUN VERB VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT X PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ ADJ ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'NUM', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188], [-188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0], 'Task']

BLT patients had a greater reduction of depressive symptoms than WLC on the HADS-D only. After WLC participants were reassigned to CT or BLT, a superiority of CT over BLT was found on the BDI-II at posttreatment. Patients of both active conditions showed a good sustainment of treatment gains at follow-ups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough replication with larger samples is needed, these results confirm the efficacy of CT for depression in the context of breast cancer and suggest that BLT could be of some utility when CT is not available or desired.

This numerical simulation employed a perturbation method, Newton Raphson method and multigrid method with full approximation technique to solve simultaneously both the time-dependent Reynolds equation, with non-Newtonian fluid based on a Carreau model, and the elasticity equation. The general numerical schemes are implemented to investigate the characteristics of elastohydrodynamic lubrication in human artificial knee joints; profiles of pressure and film thickness are determined, with varying material and lubricant properties, applied loads and speeds. The results show that the elastohydrodynamic fluid film thickness between the metallic component of the artificial knee joint and the soft polyethylene bearing becomes larger as the contact area increases and the fluid film pressure decreases. At the beginning of the first walking cycle, the film thickness is lower than in subsequent cycles because of the time required to develop the fluid film; after the first cycle, the fluid film is similar for every cycle and is dependent on transient applied load and speed during human movement.', 'PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP VERB PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PART VERB ADV CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET PROPN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT ADP VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP ADP ADJ NOUN ADP ADP DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ ADP ADJ VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174], [-171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

Penelitian ini menggunakan metode analisis event study yang banyak dipakai dalam penelitian-penelitian event study, antara lain oleh Suryawijaya dan Setiawan (1998), Affandi, et al (1998), dan Paultje (2001). Langkah pertama yang dilakukan adalah menentukan periode penelitian. Periode penelitian yang digunakan adalah 70 hari bursa yang terdiri dari periode estimasi (estimation period) dan periode peristiwa (event period). Periode estimasi yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah selama 60 hari, yaitu t-65 hingga t-6 sebelum event day tanggal 1 Maret 2005 (kenaikan harga BBM 1) dan 1 Oktober 2005 (kenaikan harga BBM 2). Hasil penelitian pada kenaikan harga BBM tanggal 1 Maret 2005 dan 1 Oktober 2005 menyebabkan adanya fluktuasi harga saham di Bursa Efek Jakarta. Reaksi pasar modal terhadap adanya kenaikan harga BBM memang bisa diduga mengingat isu seputar kenaikan BBM sudah beredar sebelum tanggal kenaikan. Harga saham bereaksi saat ada pengumuman tentang kenaikan harga BBM, tetapi berdasarkan hasil penelitian menunjukkan perbedaan abnormal return dan total volume perdagangan tidak signifikan pada sebelum dan sesudah pengumuman kenaikan harga BBM. Selain itu tidak terdapat perbedaan rata-rata abnormal return yang signifikan kenaikan harga BBM 1 Maret 2005 dengan 1 Oktober 2005.', 'PUNCT ADJ NUM NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN PROPN NOUN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT PUNCT NOUN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT PUNCT NOUN NOUN INTJ VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NUM ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN X NOUN NOUN NUM ADJ PUNCT VERB PROPN ADJ PROPN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ NUM PROPN NUM PUNCT NOUN VERB PROPN NUM PUNCT VERB NUM PROPN NUM PUNCT NOUN VERB PROPN NUM PUNCT PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN ADJ NUM PROPN NUM NOUN NUM PROPN NUM NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB X PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT VERB NOUN ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB PROPN VERB NOUN NOUN ADJ CCONJ NOUN NOUN PROPN NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN NUM PROPN NUM NOUN NUM NOUN NUM PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'PROPN PROPN PROPN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190], [-188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

Structural studies indicate that activation of RIPK3 by RIPK1 involves the formation of oligomers via interactions of the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains shared by both proteins; however, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. To gain insight into this process, we constructed versions of RIPK3 that could be induced to dimerize or oligomerize in response to a synthetic drug. Using this system, we find that although the formation of RIPK3 dimers is itself insufficient to trigger cell death, this dimerization seeds a RHIM-dependent complex, the propagation and stability of which is controlled by caspase-8 and RIPK1. Consistent with this idea, we find that chemically enforced oligomerization of RIPK3 is sufficient to induce necroptosis, independent of the presence of the RHIM domain,', 'PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADJ NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET DET VERB VERB ADV ADV VERB PUNCT PART VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN ADP NOUN DET VERB VERB VERB PART VERB CCONJ VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN VERB PRON ADJ PART VERB NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET VERB VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADV VERB NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADJ PART VERB NOUN PUNCT ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132], [-130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

The synoptic study shows that the upper-level front moved without significant change over the radar during the observation period, from 0000 UTC 14 November 1987 to 0000 UTC 15 November 1987. This allows radar data height–time cross sections to be interpreted as representing the corresponding spatial data distributions. A radar technique of stable airmass detection using the measurement of the aspect ratio, that is, the vertical to oblique power ratio, and the turbulence, that is, the structure constant of the refractive index fluctuations C2N, is developed.

We conclude that in chicken, pigeon, and great blue heron hatchlings exposed early in incubation to low doses of TCDD, hepatic ER levels and plasma estradiol concentrations are not biomarkers of toxicity.', 'CCONJ NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NUM NOUN ADV ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ PUNCT NUM NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADV ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN DET VERB VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP VERB ADV ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ PROPN NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT NOUN X NUM PUNCT CCONJ VERB NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT NOUN X NUM PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADJ PROPN NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN NOUN VERB ADV NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'PROPN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174], [-173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0], 'Process']

The virologic data provided by GPLN underpin the global polio eradication initiative, guiding decisions regarding where targeted immunization activities should be conducted, based on confirmed wild or vaccine-derived poliovirus circulation. The data also are used to monitor progress toward polio eradication by documenting the genetic diversity and transmission links of viral isolates.

Methods and Material : The prospective study included 33 patients with 40 eyes and was carried out for 1 year at our ter- tiary care teaching hospital. Patient with unilateral/bilateral epiphora were selected for both the tests after screening them for nasolacrimal duct system block by sac syringing. Other causes of epiphora were excluded. Nuclear scintigraphy using technetium 99 DTPA was performed followed by dacrocystography using water soluble dye in all patients. Results: Scintigraphy showed 92.68% positive results and 7.31 % negative (false negative) for the block and dacrocystogra- phy gave 78.04% positive and 21.95 % negative(false negative). Conclusion: Nuclear scintigraphy can be used effectively as a valuable diagnostic tool for diagnosing functional and mechanical obstruction in patients before doing a Dacrocystorhinostomy and can be used as first line of investigation for diagnosis. Introduction: Tearing process was first studied with radioisotopes in 1973. Epiphora is the presenting complaint of patients with block- age of nasolacrimal duct system. Both ophthalmologists and otorhinolaryngologists deal with the diagnosis and treatment of nasolacrimal duct block. The surgical intervention is a Dac- rocystorhinostomy in case of nasolacrimal duct block, done endoscopically by an Otorhinolaryngologist and externally by an ophthalmologist. There are various tests performed to diagnose the level of nasolacrimal duct block such as fluorescien dye test,', 'CCONJ PROPN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN NOUN PUNCT NOUN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB NUM NOUN ADP NUM NOUN CCONJ VERB VERB PART ADP NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP ADJ SYM ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP CCONJ DET NOUN ADP VERB PRON ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN VERB PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN NUM PROPN VERB VERB VERB ADP NOUN VERB NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB NUM NOUN ADJ NOUN CCONJ NUM NOUN ADJ PUNCT ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN VERB NUM NOUN ADJ CCONJ NUM NOUN NUM ADJ PUNCT PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP VERB DET PROPN CCONJ VERB VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADP NOUN ADP NUM PUNCT PROPN VERB DET VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB ADV ADP DET PROPN CCONJ ADV ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADJ ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'ADJ PUNCT NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226], [-224, -223, -222, -221, -220, -219, -218, -217, -216, -215, -214, -213, -212, -211, -210, -209, -208, -207, -206, -205, -204, -203, -202, -201, -200, -199, -198, -197, -196, -195, -194, -193, -192, -191, -190, -189, -188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Task']

Of these patients, 46.5% received ciprofloxacin alone (mean age, 52 years; range, 18-87 years), 25.5% received doxycycline alone (mean age, 30 years; range, 18-45 years) and 21% received both ciprofloxacin and doxycycline (mean age, 33 years; range 18-49 years). In 26.4% of cases, verbal advice to attend a genito-urinary medicine clinic was given, whilst a formal telephone referral was made in only one case. Formal urological follow-up was arranged for only three out of 11 patients aged > 50 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough a joint emergency department/urology clinical protocol for the investigation and treatment of acute epididymo-orchitis already exists within the Trust, our current management conforms to this in only a minority of cases. Many different strategies can be employed in the implementation of clinical practice guidelines and all are associated with variable degrees of success. The regular movement of junior staff through each department necessitates that the distribution of management protocols and guidelines occurs at frequent intervals throughout the year and that their implementation is continuously monitored so that, if necessary, further implementation strategies can be employed.', 'PUNCT NOUN VERB VERB ADP NUM NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB VERB ADP NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN VERB NOUN ADV PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NUM SYM NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT NUM NOUN VERB NOUN ADV PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NUM SYM NUM NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NUM NOUN VERB CCONJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT VERB NUM SYM NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADP NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADV NUM NOUN PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADV NUM ADP ADP NUM NOUN VERB X NUM NOUN PUNCT SPACE NOUN SPACE ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN SYM ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADV VERB ADP DET PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET ADP ADV DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADP DET NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADP ADP PUNCT ADP ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB VERB PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'PROPN NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201], [-198, -197, -196, -195, -194, -193, -192, -191, -190, -189, -188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

Contrarily, under NGO administered projects, the systematic participation in EIA is quite unknown and often goes without being acknowledged.

With regards to the fight against HIV / AIDS, many African countries show slow progress in implementing efficient and effective strategies to counter this pandemic. The fact that most HIV/AIDS programs in Sub-Saharan African countries are still very dependent on external funding to carry out their activities, including the supply of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART), highlights the concern of sustainability. So far, solutions that have been proposed are mainly symptomatic, claiming more budget commitment from government. Without rejecting this view, we call for the implementation of sustainable solutions to deal with the long term ART challenges. A way forward is to promote the establishment of an effective machinery for the manufacturing and large scale distribution of ART. In addition to the health gains, we argue that such an initiative would have a three-dimensional impact: (i) political, (ii) economic and (iii) social.', 'PUNCT VERB VERB PUNCT ADV ADV ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN SYM PROPN PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN SYM PROPN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADV ADV ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB PART DET NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT NOUN DET VERB VERB VERB VERB ADV ADJ PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP VERB DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PROPN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP DET DET NOUN VERB VERB DET NUM PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADJ CCONJ PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADJ PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'PROPN PROPN PROPN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158], [-156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Material']

Thick films which were dip coated for 5 minutes and sintered at 750 o C show the highest sensitivity towards LPG which is ten times higher than undoped SnO2 sensors. The characterization of the sensors was done using XRD, EDX and SEM.

This ability has been used to optimize band alignment or for so-called Auger suppression.3 Moreover, the material’s flexibility lends itself to novel detector designs, an advantage that has been further expanded by incorporating aluminum antimonide (', 'PUNCT PROPN PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADV PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN PROPN PUNCT NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET VERB ADV ADJ ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN PUNCT VERB DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT ADV NOUN ADP CCONJ ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB NOUN PROPN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV ADP NOUN NOUN DET VERB VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PART VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN DET ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP ADV PUNCT VERB PROPN X ADV PUNCT DET NOUN PROPN NOUN VERB PRON ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN DET VERB VERB ADV VERB ADP VERB NOUN NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN ADV', 'PROPN', [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175], [-176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0], 'Process']

Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) result shows that printed particles are sintered very well; relative high resistivity is caused by the porous structure. The low temperature sintering is attributed to the reduced copper and nickel from etched oxidation surfaces. The reduced copper and nickel small particles have high surface energy and tend to sinter with each other; this process can cause solid diffusion among constantan particles. This process has been proved by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential thermal analysis (DTA). Chemical reduction sintering method can also be used to sinter alloy particles at low temperature and make printed alloy sensors on flexible substrates.', 'PUNCT CCONJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB ADV VERB ADV PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP VERB NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADV PUNCT ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB PART VERB ADP DET ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119], [-118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0], 'Process']

In situ hybridization histochemistry showed mRNA for hGRH in liver, pituitary, pancreas, spleen, and in most other tissues examined. Combined ISH and immunohistochemistry in the pituitary gland showed that some of the GH cells also produced hGRH, and ultrastructural immunohistochemical analysis of pituitaries showed that GH and hGRH were localized in the same cell and within the same secretory granules. Liver cells of MT-hGRH transgenic mice showed evidence of hypertrophy, and the pancreatic islets were hyperplastic with significant increases in the islet cell areas. The morphologic changes in the liver were distinctive enough to separate control littermates from MT-hGRH transgenic mice in all cases. The enlarged pancreatic islets had increased numbers of insulin-producing cells. Immunoreactive hGRH and hGRH mRNA were both localized in islet cells, and an intense hybridization signal of hGRH mRNA, but only weak staining for hGRH protein, were detected in the liver of transgenic mice. These results indicate that excessive hGRH production leads to distinct morphologic changes in various organs in MT-hGRH transgenic mice and that there is temporal progression from hyperplasia to adenomatous somatotrophs in pituitaries with chronic stimulation by hGRH that involves paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine mechanisms.', 'PUNCT ADV VERB VERB NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PROPN CCONJ PROPN NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN ADP PROPN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT VERB PROPN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADV VERB PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ ADV PART VERB NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN PUNCT ADJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN VERB DET VERB ADP NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADV ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP ADJ PROPN NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADP ADV VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN DET VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'ADJ NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217], [-215, -214, -213, -212, -211, -210, -209, -208, -207, -206, -205, -204, -203, -202, -201, -200, -199, -198, -197, -196, -195, -194, -193, -192, -191, -190, -189, -188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

We investigated whether intraoperative ketamine administration could decrease perioperative opioid requirements in trauma patients undergoing cervical spine surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed anesthesia records identifying cervical spine surgeries performed between March 2014 and February 2015. All patients received a balanced anesthetic technique utilizing sevoflurane 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and propofol infusion (50-100 mcg/kg/min). For intraoperative analgesia, one group of patients received ketamine (N=25) and a second group received fentanyl (N=27). Cumulative opioid doses in the recovery room and until 24 hours postoperatively were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFewer patients in the ketamine group (11/25 [44%] vs. 20/27 [74%], respectively; p = 0.03) required analgesics in the recovery room. Additionally, the total cumulative opioid requirements in the ketamine group decreased postoperatively at both 3 and 6 hours (p = 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nKetamine use during cervical spine surgery decreased opioid requirements in both the recovery room and in the first 6 hours postoperatively. This may have the potential to minimize opioid induced respiratory depression in a population at increased risk of airway complications related to the surgical procedure.', 'PUNCT NOUN NOUN DET VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT SPACE NOUN SPACE PRON ADV VERB NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADP PROPN NUM CCONJ PROPN NUM PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN NUM NOUN ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM SYM NUM NOUN SYM NOUN SYM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN ADP NOUN VERB NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP NUM NOUN ADV VERB VERB PUNCT SPACE NOUN SPACE ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT NUM PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT X NUM PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADV PUNCT PUNCT X NUM PUNCT VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN PUNCT NOUN X NUM PUNCT PUNCT SPACE NOUN SPACE NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN ADP CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP DET ADJ NUM NOUN ADV PUNCT DET VERB VERB DET NOUN PART VERB NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187], [-187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0], 'Material']

Differential yields were integrated to obtain total sputter yields. The measured total yields were generally less than, but comparable to, published values. The dependence of total yield on angle of incidence was also investigated. The total yields were found to be largest for angles of incidence between 45° and 60°. The effects of the bombarding ion energy and the ion mass-to-target atom mass ratio on the differential yield distributions are discussed. In addition, preliminary measurements of differential sputter yields as a function of both polar and azimuthal angles are presented.

By SEM the carbon nanotubes are observed with features similar to those of some fibrous whiskers grown from pyrolytic graphite. This growth feature is supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. The TEM results show also that the graphitic sheets can be bent into curved shapes to cap the nanotubes or form the onions. In the curved graphitic sheets elastic strains induced by layer mismatches and dislocations are revealed. The STM observations on the nanotubes show a bundle-like morphology of the carbon nanotubes, and by atomic resolution images the zigzag and armchair atomic configurations may be identified. The results also show structural distortions which may be produced by folding the graphite sheets to create the nanotubes and are responsible for the lattice mismatch.', 'PUNCT CCONJ VERB NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT ADP PROPN DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP VERB NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADP DET VERB ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT DET PROPN NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN DET VERB VERB VERB ADP VERB DET NOUN NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT', 'NOUN', 'ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134], [-130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

In this context, the interaction between the cortisol with its corresponding polyclonal antibody (pAb) has been studied, and the detection event was followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Cortisol was detectable between a wide range of concentration from 2 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL. Moreover, the cross-selectivity study showed that the developed biosensor demonstrated to be highly selective toward cortisol when compared to some related biomarkers such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-\ue12d) and N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP).

The ability of mycorrhizal fungi associated with both species to grow on media amended with tannin-protein complexes as the principal N source was also compared. The protein precipitation capacity of Kalmia tannins was superior to those of black spruce. Humus amended with protein increased both mineral and microbial N, whereas humus amended with tannin-protein precipitates increased dissolved organic N. Mycorrhizal fungi associated with Kalmia showed better growth than those associated with black spruce when N was provided as tannin-protein precipitates. These data suggest that Kalmia litter increases the amount of soil N sequestered as tannin-protein complexes, which may improve the competitive ability of Kalmia relative to black spruce by favouring N uptake by mycorrhizas associated with the former.', 'PUNCT ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PART VERB ADP NOUN VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PROPN NOUN VERB ADV VERB PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN VERB ADP NOUN VERB CCONJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP VERB VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADJ PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB ADP PROPN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADV PROPN VERB VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP PROPN NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET VERB VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB PROPN NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'ADJ ADJ NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123], [-121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

['IOOS', 'Integrated Ocean Observing System', ') has been designed and implemented in Sarasota and Manatee Counties, Florida. This system is based on real-time reports from lifeguards at the eight public beaches. The lifeguards provide periodic subjective reports of the amount of dead fish on the beach, apparent level of respiratory irritation among beach-goers, water color, wind direction, surf condition, and the beach warning flag they are flying. A key component in the design of the observing system was an easy reporting pathway for the lifeguards to minimize the amount of time away from their primary duties. Specifically, we provided a Personal Digital Assistant for each of the eight beaches. The portable unit allows the lifeguards to report from their guard tower. The data are transferred via wireless Internet to a website hosted on the Mote Marine Laboratory Sarasota Operations of the Coastal Ocean Observation Laboratories (SO COOL) server. The system has proven to be robust and well received by the public. The system has reported variability from beach to beach and has provided vital information to users to minimize their exposure to toxic marine aerosols.', 'PUNCT VERB VERB VERB CCONJ VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NUM ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB VERB PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET VERB NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT PRON VERB DET PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP DET ADP DET NUM NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT ADV NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ CCONJ ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB VERB NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184], [-181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

The results support a catalytic mechanism involving coupling of two catalyst molecules. The rate constants for both RDSs were determined for all six catalysts studied. The presence of -CF3 groups had inverse effects on the two steps, with the oxidation step being fastest for the unsubstituted complexes and the bimolecular step being faster for the most electron-deficient complexes. Though the axial ligands studied here did not significantly affect the oxidation potentials of the catalysts, the nature of the ligand was found to be important not only in the bimolecular step but also in facilitating electron transfer from the metal center to the sacrificial oxidant.', 'X NUM PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT DET PROPN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN SYM PROPN NOUN NUM PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP NUM NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NUM NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NUM NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADV ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ ADV ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV ADP VERB NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'ADJ ADJ NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126], [-124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 'Process']

The low polydispersity polymers degrade in a stepwise manner into lower molecular weight (MW) fragments by 15 days at 37 °C at either pH 5.0 or pH 7.4. The half-life of the star-comb polymers in blood is dependent upon the molecular weight; the 44 kDa star-comb has a t(1/2, β) of 30.5 ± 2.1 h, which is not significantly changed (28.6 ± 2.7 h) when 6.6 wt % of DOX is attached to it via a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker. The star-comb polymers have low accumulation in organs but a high accumulation in C26 flank tumors implanted in Balb/C mice. The hydrodynamic diameter of polymer-DOX conjugates measured by dynamic light scattering increases from 8 to 35 to 41 nm as the loading is increased from 6.6 to 8.4 to 10.2 wt %. Although there is no significant difference in the t(1/2, β) or in the accumulation of polymer-DOX in C-26 tumors, the uptake of polymer in the spleen is significantly higher for polymers with DOX loadings greater than 6.6 wt %. Polymer accumulation in other vital organs is independent of the DOX loading. The facile synthesis, biodegradability, long circulation time, and high tumor accumulation of the attached drug suggests that the water-soluble star-comb polymers have promise in therapeutic applications.', 'PUNCT VERB ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN VERB NUM ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN ADP NUM NOUN ADP NUM NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NUM CCONJ NOUN NUM PUNCT DET ADJ PUNCT NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NUM NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB DET PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP NUM PROPN NUM NOUN PUNCT DET VERB ADV ADV VERB PUNCT NUM PROPN NUM PUNCT PUNCT ADV NUM NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN VERB VERB ADP PRON ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN NOUN VERB ADP PROPN SYM PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN NOUN VERB ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NUM ADP NUM PART NUM NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB ADP NUM ADP NUM ADP NUM NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PROPN ADP PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADP NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADJ ADP NUM NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET VERB NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN VERB NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT', 'PROPN', 'ADJ NOUN', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221], [-220, -219, -218, -217, -216, -215, -214, -213, -212, -211, -210, -209, -208, -207, -206, -205, -204, -203, -202, -201, -200, -199, -198, -197, -196, -195, -194, -193, -192, -191, -190, -189, -188, -187, -186, -185, -184, -183, -182, -181, -180, -179, -178, -177, -176, -175, -174, -173, -172, -171, -170, -169, -168, -167, -166, -165, -164, -163, -162, -161, -160, -159, -158, -157, -156, -155, -154, -153, -152, -151, -150, -149, -148, -147, -146, -145, -144, -143, -142, -141, -140, -139, -138, -137, -136, -135, -134, -133, -132, -131, -130, -129, -128, -127, -126, -125, -124, -123, -122, -121, -120, -119, -118, -117, -116, -115, -114, -113, -112, -111, -110, -109, -108, -107, -106, -105, -104, -103, -102, -101, -100, -99, -98, -97, -96, -95, -94, -93, -92, -91, -90, -89, -88, -87, -86, -85, -84, -83, -82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -77, -76, -75, -74, -73, -72, -71, -70, -69, -68, -67, -66, -65, -64, -63, -62, -61, -60, -59, -58, -57, -56, -55, -54, -53, -52, -51, -50, -49, -48, -47, -46, -45, -44, -43, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -37, -36, -35, -34, -33, -32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21, -20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0], 'Process']
